# News_API
### Problem Statement
1. Need to create web API for the listing of news and searching news with keywords
2. Need to write a small scraper for below JSON links and get the news on one API call for current
date and store it in the table in this format (Id, Date, Title, Details, New From (CNN, Times,
etc.) and URL of News)
3. You need to ensure that no duplicate news gets entered in the table via scraper
4. News can be searched via any keyword in title or in detail field
5. Also, we will need API to delete any news by passing ID and we need separate API to update
the news details
6. Write a small authentication mechanism which will give JWT token and this token will be used
to call any other APIâ€™s. If the token gets expired, then no result with be shown
